# Deep Learning ND101 Projects

## Project 1 - FeedForward Network

This was my first deep network. Written with Python and no other frameworks to do the heavy lifting of the Math for me.  In this project, I got to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! I got a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before I move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. 

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Project 2 - Image Classification

In this project, I classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. I normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. 

## Project 3 - RNN TV Script Generation

In this project, I generate Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I use part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. This Neural Network generates a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

## Project 4 - Seq2Seq RNN Encoder-Decoder Language Translator (English to French)

In this project, I trained a *sequence to sequence* model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

## Project 5 - Digits and Face generation with a Generative Adversarial Network

In this project, I use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces and digits from the MNIST dataset.
